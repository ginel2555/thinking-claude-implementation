# Thinking Claude Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Thinking Claude project, which adds comprehensive thinking and reasoning capabilities to Claude's responses.

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Model Instructions**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Claude to think deeply and systematically before responding.
2. **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension that makes Claude's thinking process more readable and manageable.
